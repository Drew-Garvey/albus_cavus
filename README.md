# Introduction
This is the scaffold. It will be the boilerplate for all things here on out (hopefully). Let's make some dope-ass shit, gentlemen.

## Setup
Clone this repo and have it on deck for future projects.

```apache
git clone git@github.com:Proof757/scaffold.git
```
Be certain that you have grunt and bower installed globally on your machine. If not, run these functions. Also, be sure to have Node installed as well. If you don't, get on that. That's a bad look.

```apache
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install -g bower
```

Next setup grunt and bower for your new repo.

```apache
npm install
bower install
```
Don't worry about dependencies for now. The defaults for grunt and bower are in package.json and bower.json, respectivly.

Run grunt and be sure you don have any errors.

That should be it! Happy coding.
